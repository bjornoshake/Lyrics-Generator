# Starting the projet

The idea here is to allow to make a speech generator based on the Open AI: GPT 2.

For this, we will use Google Colab for the training part, but first of all, we need to have access to a dataset of lyrics, so that our program can train on it: Hence the interest of the LyricsScrapper.py script, which will allow us to retrieve through the Genius API a large sample of artists' lyrics.
